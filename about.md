I am working on democratizing intelligence for every company at ByteDance.

Previously, I was a Senior Director at Momenta.ai leading a team of engineers and PMs to build data infra and simulation for autonomous driving. Within my 3 years tenure, we built the largest simulation platform in China in terms of scale from scratch and won "Platform of the Year" in 2022 and 2023.

Prior to Momenta.ai, I was spearheading the strategy of Volcengine at ByteDance. Before that, I was working on investment in AI and Infrastructure. I have also founded/co-founded various startups and organizations, including GGU Consulting, MIT CEO, MIT Energy Hackathon.
